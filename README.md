# About this repository:
AES128_C is an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standards using 128-bit keys in accordance to the Federal Information Processing Standards-197 (FIPS197) using C language.
Right now the project is under development, the main intention is to create a terminal cryptographer with a minimalist user interface. Future plans include a creation of a cryptography API for embedded systems to use with a integration interface to make integration feasible and promptly done.

# What is going on right now?
Recently a linux branch was created, in order to integrate the code (previously developed in a Windows enviroment) to a linux enviroment. So far the user interface works fine and the AES-128 algorithm works fine as well. The main challenge is to develop a file handling system in order to store and retrieve ciphers.

# Progress:
The following steps marked with a ✔️  are already implemented and have been tested, steps marked with ⚠️  need to be implemented and tested and steps marked with a :hammer_and_wrench: are currently under development

- :heavy_check_mark:  AES-128 cryptography working.
- :heavy_check_mark:  User interface workin.
- :hammer_and_wrench: Create an integration interface in order to adapt code to linux enviroment. 
- :hammer_and_wrench: Create a file handling system to retrieve and store ciphers in files.

# About me:
Hello and welcome to this repository page. Feel free to get in contact with me or to contribute to this project. It is a small personal project that I intend to make it grow.
I am an electrical engineer specialized in the telecommunications field and I recently arrived in the work market. My knowledge around programming practices in industry is really limited, so any advice is greatly appreciated.
