# About this repository:
AES128_C is an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standards using 128-bit keys in accordance to the Federal Information Processing Standards-197 (FIPS197) using C language.
Right now the project is under development, the main intention is to create a terminal cryptographer with a minimalist user interface. Future plans include a creation of a cryptography API for embedded systems to use with a integration interface to make integration feasible and promptly done.

# What is going on right now?
linux branch was merged into the main branch, the OS adaptation worked fine and program now works on both linux and windows environments. The file handling interface still needs to be done.

# Progress:
The following steps marked with a ✔️  are already implemented and have been tested, steps marked with ⚠️  need to be implemented and tested and steps marked with a :hammer_and_wrench: are currently under development

- :heavy_check_mark:  AES-128 cryptography working.
- :heavy_check_mark:  User interface workin.
- :heavy_check_mark:  Create an integration interface in order to adapt code to linux enviroment. 
- :hammer_and_wrench: Create a file handling system to retrieve and store ciphers in files.

# About me:
Hello and welcome to this repository page. Feel free to get in contact with me or to contribute to this project. It is a small personal project that I intend to make it grow.
I am an electrical engineer specialized in the telecommunications field and I recently arrived in the work market. My knowledge around programming practices in industry is really limited, so any advice is greatly appreciated.
